Having some issues with the menu, chrome gives me a "event listener null" or suttin like that. 

The main nav is called ".mainNav" and is pushed off the page with:   transform: translateY(-130px)
when the burger toggle, called ".nav-Burger" is clicked, the transform is supposed to be disabled or reduced to transform: translateY(0px), 
while the padding on "body" is increased from: "padding: 5px 5px 80px 5px" to "padding: 135px 5px 80px 5px", clearing enough space for the menu. 

It may not be the best way to do this, so feel free to fuck about with it. The burger-nav css is pretty wiley, so dont be scared, 
its got loads of cool transitions.

Finally, here is the orginal codepen.io sketch I got this coolness from: http://codepen.io/aderaaij/pen/ogzPbV

good luck!
